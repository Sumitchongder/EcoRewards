Security fixes, if required, will be applied to the most recent version.

directly via email.

## Out-of-Scope Issues

- Issues caused by third-party browser extensions

## Responsible Disclosure

We request that security researchers:

- Act in good faith
- Avoid public disclosure before a fix is available
- Limit testing to what is necessary to demonstrate the issue

## Disclaimer

EcoRewards is currently a frontend demonstration platform.
It should not be used for real financial transactions without
additional backend security, authentication, and validation layers.
